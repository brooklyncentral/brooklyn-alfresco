# Perform releases

## SNAPSHOT releases

`master` branch should only contains `SNAPSHOT` version. Upon every commit pushed on `master`, Circle CI will build, sign
then deploy `SNAPSHOT` version to sonatype automatically.

## Official releases

To perform an official release, simply create a branch `release/<version>`, update the version number in the code then push
your changes. Circle CI will pick up and build the branch but then hold for a manual action to deploy artifacts to sonatype.

You will need to log on [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) and manually unhold the corresponding release workflow on [this page](https://circleci.com/gh/brooklyncentral/workflows/).

Finally, you will need to log into [sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) then close and release the artifact built and deployed by Circle CI.

## Manual releases

You can always perform manual releases by running the following command:

```bash
mvn source:jar javadoc:jar deploy -DdeployTo=sonatype --settings .circleci/settings.xml
```

Note that you need to setup the following environment variables:


| Environment variable | Value                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SONATYPE_USER        | Sonatype user                                                                                     |
| SONATYPE_PASSWORD    | Sonatype password                                                                                 |
| GPG_EXECUTABLE       | GPG executable, e.g. `gpg`                                                                        |
| GPG_SECRET_KEY       | GPG secret key to use. You can get it be running: `gpg -a --export-secret-keys <KEY-ID> | base64` |
| GPG_PASSPHRASE       | The passphrase of the <KEY-ID>                                                                    |
